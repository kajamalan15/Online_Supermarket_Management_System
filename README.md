#Online_Supermarket_Management_System

As part of a group project at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT), I helped develop an Online Supermarket Management System for Northway Family Mart using the MERN stack. This web application transitioned the store from offline to online operations, enhancing customer experience and internal efficiency. My role focused on Inventory Management, where I implemented CRUD operations to track and manage stock levels, ensuring optimal inventory control. Additionally, I incorporated report generating, calculation, and search functionalities. The system featured user management, product management, order management, shopping cart functionality, promotions, customer reviews, and comprehensive reporting and analytics. This project not only streamlined Northway Family Martâ€™s operations but also provided a scalable platform for future growth.
